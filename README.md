# How-To's

## How to create a map game
1. Figure out the place you want to guess.
1. Create the KML file(s) for the place, add them to repo.
1. Create the database record for the place -- [www/newgame.bash](www/newgame.bash) streamlines this process, and should be run from the command line of the server you're running this on.
1. Create the markup for the particular mapgame. [Here's one example of this](www/games/map-find-boundary.html)
1. Upload the markup to production ([example](http://extras.denverpost.com/app/mapgame/games/moscow.html)), then iframe it into an article ([example](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/12/map-game-russia-moscow/)).

## How to get started with a dev environment
1. Check out this repo. `git clone git@github.com:denverpost/mapgame.git`
1. Symlink the repo's www directory into an active webserver on your computer.
1. To start on testing the backend, take a look at the sql in www/admin/tables.sql
